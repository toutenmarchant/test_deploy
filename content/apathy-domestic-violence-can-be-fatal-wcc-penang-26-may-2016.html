<p><span class="caps">WCC</span> senior advocacy officer Melissa Mohd Akhir said members, including police and social welfare officers, should understand domestic violence laws, and the rights ofvictims to protection under the law, as well as undergo training to grasp and appreciate their roles in preventing domestic violence as laid out under the law and the Guidelines to Handling Domestic Violence&nbsp;Cases.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>In reference to a High Court decision on Tuesday, which found former loan shark-turned-hawker Chiam Nguang Huat guilty of murdering his wife Lai Siew Fong in 2013, Melissa said the victim had made numerous police reports on the violence she had faced at the hands of her husband since September&nbsp;2012.</p>
<p>“These reports made by her and her family members did not receive the appropriate attention, nor were the proper actions&nbsp;taken.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>“The failure of our enforcement agencies to intervene despite repeated reports of violence contributed to the further repetition and escalation of the violence, which ultimately resulted in Lai’s horrific&nbsp;murder.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">WCC</span> journeyed initially with the victim and later with her family throughout the police investigation and trial process,” she said in astatement on&nbsp;Tuesday.</p>
<p>Melissa said despite the protections offered to domestic violence victims under the <span class="caps">DVA</span> (Domestic Violence Act) 1994 and the recently launched Guidelines to Handling Domestic Violence Cases by the Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development, domestic violencevictims often faced numerous difficulties in getting the help and protection they&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>“From our experience, many officers in enforcement agencies do not understand domestic violence, and do not know their duties as ascribed by the law or how to carry out those duties&nbsp;effectively.</p>
<p>“Often, victims find theircomplaints not taken seriously by the very agencies whom they seek help&nbsp;from.</p>
<p>“While domestic violence has been legislated against, certain forms of it are still not recognised by enforcement officers as a crime,” she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>Melissa added that some victims were not informed about their rights, including access to protection orders while many officers in enforcement agencies “seem unaware” of their responsibilities, resulting in multiple instances where victims were not helped to obtain a protection order, or where the protection order was not delivered to the suspect&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she added, poorcommunication between the agencies could result in lack of protection of the victim, rendering them vulnerable to further and more severe abuse from the&nbsp;perpetrator.</p>
<p>“It has taken three years for Lai’s case to come to a&nbsp;conclusion.</p>
<p>“The case has had a profound and harrowing effect on her family, especially her children who witnessed the&nbsp;crime.</p>
<p>“To ensure that other women do not suffer the same fate as Lai Siew Fong, we need to act now to collectively overcome the inertia and apathy shown towards domestic violence and its victims,” she&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Chiam, 42, was sentenced to death by a High Court in George Town after he was found guilty of setting his wife on fire that resulted in her death about three years&nbsp;ago.</p>
