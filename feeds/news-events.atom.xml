  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRESIDENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;S &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADDRESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;A warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for attending &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;’s 34&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Annual General
      Meeting. It is marvellous to see new and familiar faces amongst us. For the benefit of our new members, it would
      be appropriate for me to begin with a brief history of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; was established in 1983 by the diligence, foresight, sacrifice and commitment on the
      part of our founding members -  Dato’ Noor Farida Ariffin, Tan Sri Dato Seri Siti Norma Yaacob, Dato’ Ambiga
      Sreenivasan and Chen Kah Leng. In those early years, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; was one of five (5) women’s groups&lt;a href="#_ftn1"
        id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whose tireless advocacy and lobbying
      efforts culminated  in the passing of the Domestic Violence Act 1994&lt;a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2"
        title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Malaysia was a pioneer and the first country in the Asia-Pacific region
      then to have domestic violence legislation.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;However, subsequent to those early trail-blazing years, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;, under the unfortunate moniker
      of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOWL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Federation of Women
      Lawyers, Malaysia), fell into a downward spiral and appeared to have lost its significance for well over a decade.
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;Fortunately, in 2008, we managed to shed our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOWL&lt;/span&gt; feathers and went through a process of
      renewal and reinvention, emerging like a phoenix from the ashes. A few individuals were instrumental in leading
      this change to revamp the society’s structure and mission. Some of these individuals are here with us today, Ms
      Jane Pragasam, Ms Vicky Alahakone and our immediate past President, Ms Meera Samanther. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;As the society began to regain its footing, there was recognition of the need to support
      female lawyers in the profession but empirical data was required to provide credibility to any proposals or
      projects for change.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/IMG_1901_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/images/IMG_1901.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;The beginnings of an idea for a survey was suggested&lt;a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4"
        name="_ftnref4" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over a latte by Sheena Gurbakhash to our immediate
      past-President, Ms Meera Samanther. On 26 June 2014, that idea became a reality! The Findings of the Baseline
      Survey&lt;a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on the Working
      Conditions of Male and Female Lawyers in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Selangor was officially launched at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Auditorium with
      copies of the Baseline Survey ceremoniously handed to the then President of the Malaysian Bar&lt;a href="#_ftn6"
        id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Mr. Christopher Leong) and both Chairmen of
      the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; and Selangor State Bars. Notably at that time, no female lawyer had ever held the chairman post for both
      State Bars.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/IMG_1874_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/images/IMG_1874.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Baseline Survey provides hard data that women lawyers faced gender discrimination
      and vindicated what in the past, had been mere anecdotal accounts.  Key areas were identified with recommendations
      and programmes to eradicate gender inequality in the legal profession. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;In October 2016, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; was invited by the Thailand Institute of Justice (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIJ&lt;/span&gt;) to participate
      in the South East Asian Regional Roundtable Discussion on “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women As Justice-Makers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;a
        href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; held in Bangkok. We were most
      elated to have been given the privilege of presenting a copy of our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Baseline Survey to the then Australian
      Ambassador for Women &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Girls, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;H.E.&lt;/span&gt; Natasha Stott Despoja.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/IMG_2223_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/images/IMG_2223.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/IMG_2235_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/images/IMG_2235.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Baseline Survey provided the seed that grew into an organic collaboration between
      &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; and the Bar Council, leading to the formation of the Gender Equality Initiatives (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), a
      platform to raise awareness on issues on gender discrimination amongst students of local law colleges.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;Last year, the theme “&lt;strong&gt;Women in Leadership Positions&lt;/strong&gt;” was selected for the
      &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; Colloquium&lt;a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; held in June,
      2016 and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; Moot in November 2016. Special thanks to the organising team led by Meera Samantha and Santhi
      Latha, our Secretary, Kathlyn Lee who delivered the Colloquium keynote address and our Treasurer, Daniella
      Zulkifili who crafted the moot problems based on real-life case studies. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; theme and moot questions were
      intended to make the students to think and analyse why was there a dearth of women in leadership roles. Is there
      discrimination? If yes, why does such discrimination exist? What were the underlying root causes? These questions
      and more, highlight and bring into focus the barriers to a woman’s career and leadership progression - issues such
      as pregnancy and the double burden of child and elder care.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/GEI+2016-team+and+participants_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img
          src="/static/images/GEI+2016-team+and+participants.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;To me, it was an extremely befitting theme given my own personal experiences and the
      internal mental struggles I had to overcome before deciding to stand for the post of Chair at the Kuala Lumpur Bar
      Elections earlier this year, on 23 February 2017. But I did it! We did it!&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;I now move on to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Annual Report which chronicles the hard work of the society. The
      successful implementation of our projects was only possible with the passion and dedication demonstrated by my
      fellow Exco members. We do this work not for ourselves. Our success and satisfaction comes from helping other
      people, advocating for gender-sensitive laws and policies&lt;a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9"
        title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, working for a more inclusive bar and educating others&lt;a href="#_ftn10"
        id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We work so that the term “feminist”
      will one day shed its unfair negative connotations and to narrow the gender gap&lt;a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11"
        name="_ftnref11" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;The next stage is for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; to continue on its mission to advocate for an enabling environment
      for women lawyers. A platform for women lawyers to speak out about what we can do for one another. Mentoring,
      friendships, supportive networks whether formal or informal. To help someone behind us to accomplish and fulfil
      their fullest potential, to level the playing field.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;Next, is a project close to my heart, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;’s Child Sexual Crimes team. This originally
      began in late 2015 as a Standard Operating Procedure (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOP&lt;/span&gt;) project in collaboration with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;’s Chambers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCC&lt;/span&gt;
      Penang, relevant governmental stakeholders and child-focused NGOs.
      &lt;p&gt;In 2016, one representative each from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCC&lt;/span&gt; Penang, were selected to represent the Joint Action Group for
        Gender Equality (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt;) at the Sexual Crimes Taskforce&lt;a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12" name="_ftnref12"
          title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which led to the eventual tabling of the Sexual Offences Against
        Children Bill (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOAC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13" name="_ftnref13" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
        It gives me great delight to inform you today that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOAC&lt;/span&gt; Bill was passed last night by the Dewan Negara&lt;a
          href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14" name="_ftnref14" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/IMG_0074_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/images/IMG_0074.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;We would like to thank Melissa Akhir of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCC&lt;/span&gt; Penang and our Vice President, Tham Hui Ying.
      Melissa (also an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; member) and Hui Ying were tremendous sources of support during the hectic weeks in March and
      April this year during our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOAC&lt;/span&gt; engagement with Parliamentarians. It’s been a wonderful journey. So far,
      what moves each and every one of us is the possibility of making a difference and the exhilarating feeling that
      comes when we see it crystallise and happen.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p class="rtejustify"&gt;Needless to say, our work to strengthen victim support services for child victims of sexual
        crimes is far from over. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; continues to support the Star’s R.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGE&lt;/span&gt; Team in this area. Most recently, we have
        been invited to participate in the filming of a mock trial&lt;a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15" name="_ftnref15"
          title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[15]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the new offence of sexual grooming, to take place next&amp;nbsp;Saturday. 
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="/static/images/IMG_1455_full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="/static/images/IMG_1455.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;I don’t believe anyone has to wait to make a difference. Your ability to impact others never
      stops. If you say no, you only shut yourself from opportunities, like attending a networking event, meeting new
      people and transforming mindsets, others and yours. So what I would advise is, be open to opportunity and from my
      personal experience, life has begun to change in a very positive way. It has not always been easy, it is hard
      work, there are costs and sacrifice involved. However, we should take on the challenge and stretch ourselves to
      gain new experiences and skill sets.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;To conclude, how many of you have heard of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butterfly Effect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a
        href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" name="_ftnref16" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[16]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?  I read about this
      recently and it’s a powerful illustration of how little acts can result in dramatic effects. The butterfly effect
      chaos theory is that a butterfly flapping its wings in South America can affect weather patterns causing a typhoon
      halfway around the world!&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="rtejustify"&gt;So, we owe it to the next generation of women lawyers to put our hands down and pull them
      up. These small gestures will have tremendous and lasting impact on the careers of women. Together, we can be very
      powerful. Let us be part of the solution. Let us effect amazing change…  just like those butterflies, right here
      in Malaysia.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;
       &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;My ministry has always been against early marriage or child marriage as it curbs the mental, physical and psychological development of a child.&amp;#8221;Let a child be a child and go through that phase before going to study and working because a good career is more important&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See: &lt;a href="http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/minister-says-against-child-marriages-tells-malaysians-to-prioritise-career"&gt;http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/minister-says-against&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a position is laudatory and consistent with the international consensus that the definition of childhood should apply to humans up to the age of 18 years and which is based on scientific evidence. This definition of a child is intended to make sure that the period of care and physical, psychological and social preparation of the child should last for a period that is not less than 18 years which is the age at which that young person may have the physical and emotional maturity to become able to shoulder the various responsibilities expected of him or her, and may be able to make right decisions that will have a prolonged effect on his or her present and future life, such as the decision to get&amp;nbsp;married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is ample statistical and medical data that child marriages are a harmful practice and frequently, the basic rights of the girl child are violated, depriving them of their basic right of choice. Such rights include, her right to an education, her right to a life free from violence and abuse (bearing in mind that marital rape remains an exception under the Penal Code) and medical risks which may include &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; infection, death during childbirth and medical conditions like obstetric fistula. We need to highlight the lived realities of these children to expose the grave injustices that they face by condoning the practice of child&amp;nbsp;marriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Sustainable Development Goals 5 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDG&lt;/span&gt; 5) seeks to &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; Such goals must be imbedded in our legal system. It cannot be emphasised enough that if child marriage remains unaddressed, this would inevitably and negatively impact on the nation&amp;#8217;s attainment of other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDG&lt;/span&gt; goals (eg SDGs 1, 3, 4, 8 and&amp;nbsp;16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be relevant at this juncture, to refer to other notable publications on the issue. In particular, the joint report by Al Azhar University and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/span&gt;, reveal that child marriage is a mere custom with significant adverse effects. The relevant passage is reproduced below: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Child marriage is no more than a custom; it is not part of Sharia or worship and it leads without doubt to significant adverse effects. Therefore, the preferred age of marriage is after the age of 18 years. Marriage is a religious and social responsibility that demands the ability and willingness of both husband and wife to bear its responsibilities, so it is not right to apply this burden to children.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/egypt/eg_Joint_book_high_res_Eng.(1).pdf"&gt;https://www.unicef.org/egypt/eg_Joint_book_high_res_Eng.(1).pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Fatwa Council has on 1.11.2014, published an e-Fatwa on the government’s official website, this was reported as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Child marriages are not wajib (obligatory) or sunnah (encouraged), according to religious scholars with the National Fatwa Committee, which has published an e-Fatwa on the government’s official&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There is no hadith supporting child marriages. Marriages in the time of Prophet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;S.A.W.&lt;/span&gt; conducted by his friends were more to safeguard the welfare of&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Though it is included in issues that are legal, it is subject to the provisions of Maqasid Sharia and Qaedah Fiqhiyyah,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fatwa states “that among the conclusions reached by the committee, based on the findings of the study, were that the issue of child marriages was not new in Malaysia and it was no longer seen as a “healthy” practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2014/12/01/child-marriages-harm-good-says-fatwa-council/"&gt;http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2014/12/01/child-marriages-harm-good-says-fatwa-council/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must promote and enhance the physical and mental development of our young girls and boys and their human rights as a whole. We hope that genuine and continuing open dialogue will reveal how unacceptable this practice is in a social and legal sense, for all women and&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us take the first step based on empirical and scientific evidence, data and research to work together to effect attitudinal and legislative change for the eradication of child&amp;nbsp;marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the least we can do, we owe it to our&amp;nbsp;children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

As such, the decision whether or not to undergo an abortion is one which should be made by the pregnant woman upon being provided with the information regarding the&amp;nbsp;medical&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; September,&amp;nbsp;2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association of Women Lawyers views with serious concern the Ministry of Health’s decision to consult the National Fatwa Council on the issue of abortion where a woman is infected with the Zika&amp;nbsp;virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; asserts that access to proper sexual and reproductive healthcare is a right guaranteed under Article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt;). As such, the decision whether or not to undergo an abortion is one which should be made by the pregnant woman upon being provided with the information regarding the medical risks involved for both options – to continue or not to continue the&amp;nbsp;pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is reminded that the law allows abortion to be conducted in cases where a registered medical practitioner has formed an opinion, in good faith, that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman or that it would involve injury to the mental or physical health of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated. In this context, it is important to take cognisance of the mental health consequences for women in cases involving risk of foetal abnormality, which have been well documented&amp;nbsp;globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear therefore that a decision on abortion should be based on medical considerations in relation to the pregnancy risks. While religious views may influence an individual’s decision, this is a matter of personal&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Ministry of Health has sought and is awaiting a ruling by the National Fatwa Council on medical issues raises serious implications. Firstly, there is no basis for the Ministry to consult the National Fatwa Council as the law does not require or provide for an opinion to be sought from a religious body. Secondly, the risk of foetal abnormality such as microcephaly and other complications is not exclusive to Zika infection cases, and does not require a special consideration. Thirdly, any ruling by the National Fatwa Council has no legal standing. Lastly, matters relating to Islam are confined to personal law and doctrines, in line with the Federal&amp;nbsp;Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, should a pregnant woman choose to carry her pregnancy to term, there should be support by healthcare providers to assist in the care of the child, so as to allow the woman to make an informed choice on the&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the risks associated with Zika infections in individual pregnancies can only be determined by a medical practitioner’s professional judgment on the matter, the move by the Ministry of Health is an abdication of responsibilities and creates a bad precedent for future cases involving pregnancy risks. It is important to be mindful of the legislation and reproductive rights of the woman, so as to prevent resort to unsafe&amp;nbsp;abortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kuala Lumpur Bar Committee, Association of Women Lawyers, Cowboy Food Trucks, Lokka Cafe Food Truck and Sri Anggerik distributed 500 food packets to the Rohingya community at the MyWelfare&amp;nbsp;office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the event, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM5&lt;/span&gt;,500 was donated to Rainbow of Love Informal School for Refugee&amp;nbsp;Children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyWelfare exco member Jules Rahman Ong said the distribution of food was held daily at the centre during the fasting&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="inlineAdMobile" &gt;
&lt;div id="div-gpt-ad-1459820957057-0" &gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="div-gpt-ad-1392882089877-0" &gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apart from Ramadan, we also distribute food to these refugees daily. We started the programme four months ago and were distributing about 100 to 150 packets. The number has grown rapidly and now our distribution stands at about 1,000 food packets daily not only to Rohingyas but also poor Malaysians living around the&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Among the items given out are rice, vegetables, porridge, meat, beans, potatoes and&amp;nbsp;drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Four months ago, we moved from Jalan 1 to Jalan 4 in Selayang Baru and occupy this three-storey building which is very strategic and convenient,’’ said Jules, adding that MyWelfare also provides free medical consultation, food and non-food distribution and a skills training centre for&amp;nbsp;refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embeded-image inline-image-center" &gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyWelfare also distributes food packets daily to the nearby Myanmar community and poor Malaysians on a three-wheel&amp;nbsp;motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after the food packs were distributed to Rohingyas, a volunteer filled a motorcycle with food packs and distributed them in Batu Caves and&amp;nbsp;Kepong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jules said the refugees and asylum seekers do not have the right to work legally in Malaysia and often work in informal sectors in jobs that are dirty, dangerous and dull; which are not popular with&amp;nbsp;Malaysians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Often they are underpaid and exploited and do not get sick leave. We provide them with basic necessities like shelter, food and clothing,’’ he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Association of Women Lawyers president Goh Siu Lin said they wanted to make this year more meaningful and decided to give away the food packs and also break fast with the refugees after the food was&amp;nbsp;distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rafik Ismail, 41, who is a Rohingya community leader here, said he was very grateful to Malaysians who had shown concern for the community during the fasting&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MyWelfare has been helping refugees here since 2011. Many of the refugees are unemployed but have children to&amp;nbsp;feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of them are non-Muslims and we provide them with food too,’’ he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datuk Seri Liow called for amendments to the Child Act 2001 so that Malaysia could start bringing child abusers to book in local&amp;nbsp;courthouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datuk Seri Liow, who heads the Malaysian Chinese Association, part of the ruling alliance, said current legal provisions are not adequate to deal with cases of child sexual abuse and child&amp;nbsp;pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We have to make sure these cases will never happen again,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huckle, 30, had pleaded guilty to 71 counts of child sex offences, including rape of children as young as six months&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of his crimes were committed during his stay in Malaysia between 2006 and 2014 as an English teacher and photographer. He was arrested in Britain in December 2014 and was dubbed the country&amp;#8217;s worst paedophile by Britain&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was sentenced to life in prison by a London court on Monday and would have to serve at least 23 years behind bars for his&amp;nbsp;crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysian lawyers said the country&amp;#8217;s laws are severely inadequate to deal with the wide range of sexual offences against&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They noted that there are no specific legal repercussions for the act of grooming, which often makes it easier for predators to commit sexual crimes against&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We need to have laws that prescribe certain behaviours with children as being criminal,&amp;#8221; said Association of Women Lawyers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;) president Goh Siu&amp;nbsp;Lin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of rape also has to be expanded beyond penile penetration in heterosexual&amp;nbsp;intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mr Kitson Foong, a criminal law practitioner with over 26 years of experience, Britain has very specific laws to protect&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the comprehensive Sexual Offences Act 2003, they also have the Protection of Children Act 1978 which deals with indecent photos of&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It is high time that we have our own specific Sexual Offences Act, which governs and captures all forms of sexual crime against all victims,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grooming”, the process of gaining a child’s trust for future sexual exploitation, has been criminalised in countries like Singapore, Australia, Canada and&amp;nbsp;Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Star&lt;/em&gt;’s R.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGE&lt;/span&gt; video documentary team and Unicef will bring together the child advocates and various stakeholders – including D11 and the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Develop­ment – for a townhall meeting on June 25 to discuss an action&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICMEC&lt;/span&gt;) Asia Pacific policy director Bindu Sharma said governments and NGOs around the world are “playing catch up” now, as offenders are turning to new technology to target their&amp;nbsp;victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The scale of the issue far exceeds the capacity of law enforcement to respond adequately and investigate these crimes,” said&amp;nbsp;Bindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police have received over 400 reports of Internet-related rape cases since 2010, of which 339 involved&amp;nbsp;minors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conviction rate for perpetrators of sexual crimes involving children was at 5% in 2013, according to a parliament&amp;nbsp;report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg,” said&amp;nbsp;Ong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very few rape victims will come forth to make a report because they don’t know where to seek&amp;nbsp;help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Ong encouraged victims to report these crimes, she also acknowledged that the reporting system has its&amp;nbsp;flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some victims may find the police station a complex system, or that some male police officers do not understand the trauma they have experienced,” she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goh Siu Lin, president of the Association of Women Lawyers, said: “The judiciary and prosecutors should be sensitive to child abuse cases. We need to train frontliners in getting the evidence out of the child to ensure a &lt;em&gt;prima facie &lt;/em&gt;case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was recently announced that a Child Cyber Sexual Crime investigation unit was set up within D11, but Ong said the unit needs to be “beefed&amp;nbsp;up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are more cases coming. More will be uncovered,” she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;

The event was kindly hosted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTI&lt;/span&gt; International University at their beautiful campus in Nilai, Negeri&amp;nbsp;Sembilan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Colloquium is a continuation of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; activities carried on since 2015, and is the first event for the committee this year. The competition required students to prepare a research paper on a topic of their choice which resonates with the theme, &amp;#8220;Women in Leadership&amp;#8221;. 12 participants from various universities and colleges submitted their research papers, but only 10 made it to the final event in which they had to present their research and take part in a question &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; answer&amp;nbsp;session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathlyn Lee, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s secretary gave the opening address at the event. The judges were &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s President Goh Siu Lin, Malaysian Bar representative Alex Netto, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s representative Thilaga Sulathireh of Justice for&amp;nbsp;Sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patricia Chong Su Yin from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTI&lt;/span&gt; International University emerged champion in the Colloquium with her research paper entitiled &amp;#8220;Bossy, or Being the Boss?&amp;#8221;. Her research highlights, among others, the fact that attitudes and behaviours expressed by men and women are perceived very differently depending on their gender. Low Win Li of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTI&lt;/span&gt; International University was placed second while Chia Ban Moon of Taylor&amp;#8217;s University came&amp;nbsp;third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will start with a campaign for laws against sexual grooming. To pledge your support for the campaign, go to&lt;a href="http://rage.com.my/predator" &gt;rage.com.my/predator&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/ragepmp" &gt;facebook.com/ragepmp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working closely with the police’s D11 division (Sexual, Women and Child Investigations), and we’ve seen firsthand how difficult it is to compile enough evidence to charge and convict a child sex&amp;nbsp;predator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many online sexual predators now spend weeks “grooming” young victims for exploitation. They gain their trust and manipulate their feelings until they let their guards down, and that’s when the abuse&amp;nbsp;begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGE&lt;/span&gt; encountered many such groomers while filming Predator In My Phone, but there wasn’t much we or the police could do without laws criminalising such&amp;nbsp;behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But laws against sexual grooming is just the start – Malaysia needs more comprehensive legislative reform to catch up with sex predators who are increasingly aided by&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, Unicef – with support from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt; Women: Girls and Digi – is hosting a townhall meeting on June 25, where all the various stakeholders will be discussing the best way to move&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police and Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development have already pledged their support for the campaign. Women, Family and Community Development minister Datuk Seri Rohani Abdul Karim will be present for the townhall&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others who have been invited include the Women’s Centre for Change, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; The Children and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MCMC&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young advocates and student leaders from Unicef’s various programmes will also be there to offer their perspective, so any action plan formulated will be&amp;nbsp;kid-approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unicef Malaysia representative Marianne Clark-Hattingh said there is a need to review and enhance legislation to better protect children, given the rapid expansion of communication technologies and the Internet penetration in&amp;nbsp;Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Online abuse and exploitation most often takes place in the deep privacy of the mobile phone, the computer, or any other electronic device. It can move anonymously from the private to the public sphere, and across countries and borders, quickly,” she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why input from the children is so important. The way children use technology is changing every day, and it’s impossible for the relevant authorities and agencies to keep up without their&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, D11 principal assistant director &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACP&lt;/span&gt; Ong Chin Lan said children now are engaging with people overseas, and the police have received reports of cross-border online sexual&amp;nbsp;exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the Internet, our children are not only vulnerable to local perpetrators, but also those who are overseas,” said&amp;nbsp;Ong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said there is a new trend of “travelling sex offenders”, men who would travel to countries like Malaysia and find victims through mobile chat apps. As they could be in the country for only a matter of days, the police cannot do much to stop them at the&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia actually does have laws in place to protect children against harassment and exploitation. The Penal Code, Child Act, and Communications and Multimedia Act covers things like inciting a child to gross indecency, physical harm or abuse towards children and sending or receiving obscene&amp;nbsp;material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But newer, technologically-enabled crimes like grooming often fall in a grey area, making it hard to charge the perpetrators, and even harder to get a&amp;nbsp;conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighbouring countries like Singapore and Australia already have comprehensive laws against sexual grooming, where the perpetrators can be charged even before they physically meet their&amp;nbsp;victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The townhall on June 25, which will be held at Makespace, Quill City Mall, Kuala Lumpur, will also highlight the importance of digital&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While introducing news laws would deter and punish the perpertrators, educating children on digital safety will help avoid them from being exposed to the perps in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women’s Centre for Change programme consultant Dr Prema Devaraj said digital danger is one of the biggest threats against children&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Young children are technologically-savvy and, unfortunately, this is where the sexual predators are too,” she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology has given them direct access to their target&amp;nbsp;group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIVE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THINGS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PREVENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHILD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEXUAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXPLOITATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our interviews with the police, NGOs, survivors and yes, even sex predators, here are five changes we need to combat child sexual exploitation in&amp;nbsp;Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Laws against sexual grooming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The police shouldn’t be made to wait until actual sexual exploitation has occurred. A predator should be charged even if he has shown intent to exploit a&amp;nbsp;child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Sex offender’s registry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It feels like we’ve been talking about this forever. Sex offenders, especially those who have committed crimes against children, should be registered and monitored, both by the authorities and communities they live&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Defining age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In many developed countries, a child sex offender can be charged as long as he/she believed the victim was underage, and can’t reasonably prove otherwise. This allows police officers or undercover journalists to collect&amp;nbsp;evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Worldwide protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Cyber sexual exploitation often takes place across borders these days, thanks to the Internet. The law should state clearly that it is a crime even if the exploitation takes place&amp;nbsp;overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Actually criminalise child pornography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Malaysia doesn’t actually have specific legislation on child pornography, or sexual exploitation, for that matter. Simple possession of child porn may not be a punishable offence in the&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANTI&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GROOMING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We approached the Malaysian police and various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt;’s for their comments on why it’s important we have anti-grooming laws to protect our&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With anti-grooming laws, we can take action against the perpetrator when we know that the victim is innocent and ignorant to the threat the perpetrator poses.”&lt;br/&gt;
– Bukit Aman Sexual, Women and Child Investigations Division (D11) principal assistant director &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACP&lt;/span&gt; Ong Chin&amp;nbsp;Lan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mass use of the Internet and new technologies have amplified the production and circulation of child sexual abuse materials and have increased the incidence of grooming for sexual abuse and other forms of exploitation. There would always be a need for new policy and legislation in keeping up with new technologies.”&lt;br/&gt;
– Selvi Supramaniam, Unicef Child Protection&amp;nbsp;Specialist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The internet is a shopping mall for predators, who woo the child and lulls the child into a false sense of security before taking it offline.”&lt;br/&gt;
– Natasya Saufi, board member of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; The&amp;nbsp;Children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For laws to take effect, someone has to report the crime. Anti-grooming laws will ensure a clear legal obligation for people in duty to report a suspect to the police so that investigations may take place.”&lt;br/&gt;
– Goh Siu Lin, president of Association of Women&amp;nbsp;Lawyers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Child grooming is dangerous because it is not something you can spot immediately. The child can be manipulated into a situation where they are then sexually exploited.”&lt;br/&gt;
– Dr. Prema Devaraj, programme consultant of Women’s Centre for&amp;nbsp;Change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Keeping in mind the transnational nature of online child sexual exploitation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSE&lt;/span&gt;) and the fact that the Internet knows no borders, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/span&gt; countries are no exception to the need for laws on online grooming and other manifestations of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSE&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;br/&gt;
– Bindu Sharma, Asia Pacific Policy Director of International Centre for Missing &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Exploited Children (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICMEC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Grooming laws around the World &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of rape also has to be expanded beyond penile penetration in heterosexual&amp;nbsp;intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kitson Foong, a cri­minal law practitioner with over 26 years of experience, Britain has very specific laws to protect&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the comprehensive Sexual Offences Act 2003, they also have the Protection of Children Act 1978 which deals with indecent photos of&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is high time that we have our own specific Sexual Offences Act, which governs and captures all forms of sexual crime against all victims,” he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sexual Offences Act 2003 also deals with notification requirements, or what is called a sex offen­ders&amp;nbsp;registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the current proposed amendments to Malaysia’s Child Act 2001 has the same idea, which is to formulate a&amp;nbsp;register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope this register will enable law enforcement officials to track and monitor the movements of convicted child offenders to ensure they stay away from places such as schools and playgrounds,” Foong&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;

In the Sarawak Women for Women Society’s (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWWS&lt;/span&gt;) view, part of the answer is that despite child sexual abuse regularly hitting the headlines, it is given low priority and consequently awareness is&amp;nbsp;lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is needed is for every school in the State to run classes for children on what touches are inappropriate and where to go for help” said Margaret Bedus, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWWS&lt;/span&gt;’s president. “This has been raised time and time again but people shy away from it. The result is children do not know what to do and so the sexual abuse&amp;nbsp;continues”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect children attitudes need to change. Parents, teachers and youth workers need to talk to children about these issues; be alert to changes in children’s behaviour and take seriously any comments from children about inappropriate behaviour. Priority has to be to help the child and not to protect the accused or the image of the&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People running programmes for children and youth need to realise abusers may be amongst those applying to work or volunteer. They therefore need to have standard child protection policies in place and not assume they can spot an abuser from his appearance or attitude. Huckle presented himself as a helpful person wanting to assist poor children in their Sunday school - he groomed both the adults and children to trust&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWWS&lt;/span&gt; in its recently launched manifesto Women Calling for Change, addressed the issue of child sexual abuse and made the following&amp;nbsp;recommendations:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run programmes on Child Safety and Reproductive Health in schools and also in the community so school drop-outs are reached.&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase awareness of abuse of children through the internet and have easy online reporting mechanisms for children.&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move from the current ‘Touch and Go’ situation to more systematic, long-term support for survivors of abuse.&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the capacity and skill of key agencies - this requires more resources and more training.&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child protection officers employed by the Welfare Department to be professionally qualified social workers as envisioned in the Child Act currently being amended and the proposed Social Work Act.&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend the work of the inter-agency teams dealing with abuse (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCAN&lt;/span&gt;) so they cover more of the State and also provide an effective review system.&lt;br/&gt;
     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amend the definition of rape in the Penal Code so ‘finger rape’ is&amp;nbsp;included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWWS&lt;/span&gt; strongly believes these measures will strengthen Sarawak’s ability to respond to the serious problem of child sexual abuse - as long as they are given priority and speedily&amp;nbsp;implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to move quickly.” said Margaret. “ It is over a year ago since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWWS&lt;/span&gt; raised the issue of the finger rape but there is still no date for the necessary amendments. That’s why we are saying the key issue is for everyone to give this issue priority - we know what needs to be done. If we don’t do it then we are making it easier for the&amp;nbsp;abusers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWWS&lt;/span&gt; is a member organisation of the Joint Action Group for Gender Equality (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this field research, the Women and Children Empowerment Programme team had the opportunity to interview key personnel who have outstanding contributions in support of justice for women and the role of women in the justice system in Malaysia, such as Dr.Sivananthi Thanenthiran, Executive Director of the Asian-Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARROW&lt;/span&gt;), Natasha Dandavati and Lainey Lau from the Women’s Aid Organisation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAO&lt;/span&gt;), Rozana Isa, Executive Director of Sisters in Islam, Harleen Kaur from the Kuala Lumpur Legal Aid Centre, P A Sharon, Chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Selangor Bar Committee, and Goh Siu Lin, Executive Director of Malaysia’s Association of Women Lawyers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;). The aim of this research project is to study about the rights, roles, and trajectories of women in the justice system as well as women’s access to justice in&amp;nbsp;Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the workshop came about as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; wanted more people, especially the youth, to realise that the fact that offensive statements are common does not make them acceptable. While the Aiyoh Wat Lah Awards have typically involved mostly NGOs, this time we have decided to expand our network of activists to university students. The Gender Equality Initiative (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt;), which is a collaborative effort between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;, the Bar Council and 5 institutions of higher learning is the perfect avenue for this&amp;nbsp;venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop comprised of 2 parts. Part 1, held on 2 June 2016 focused on understanding the difference between gender and sex, and that gender equality goes beyond the binary gender spectrum. Thency Gunasekaran of All Women&amp;#8217;s Action Society (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWAM&lt;/span&gt;) spoke about what gender equality means, and how we have been taught since young that our biological sex must always correspond with socially constructed ideas on&amp;nbsp;gender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second session of this Part 1 workshop focused on the politicisation of Islam in Malaysia, by Norhayati Kaprawi of Sisters in Islam. Norhayati invited the participants to reflect on how religion is used as tool to achieve political ambitions, and how this damages Malaysia&amp;#8217;s diverse&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are photos from the workshop. Part 2 will be held on 8 June&amp;nbsp;2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A five-judge Bench chaired by the Chief Judge of Malaya, Tan Sri Zulkefli Ahmad Makinudin ruled in favour of the female victim who had sued her male manager for sexual harassment in 2009. Both victim and perpetrator are no longer working in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTH&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having perused the evidence, we see no reason to disturb the learned judge&amp;#8217;s decision to dismiss main&amp;nbsp;suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are also of the view that high court decision must be affirmed but based on the tort of sexual harassment. The ingredients of sexual harassment was present in abundance,” Federal Court Justice Tan Sri Suriyadi Halim Omar, who read out the judgement,&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the unanimous decision, Suriyadi said the element of sexual harassment was evident between the perpetrator and victim, and that it eventually resulted in the latter’s emotional and mental&amp;nbsp;trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ingredients of sexual harassment are present, in abundance, namely the existence of a persistent and deliberate course of unreasonable and oppressive conduct targeted at another person (in this case the respondent), calculated to cause alarm, fear and distress to that&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This conduct is heavily spiced with sexual hallmarks as illustrated by the continuous leery and obscene verbal remarks uttered by the appellant, which culminated in the respondent displaying symptoms of emotional distress, annoyance and mental depression due to the alarm, fear and anxiety,” he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his concluding remarks, Suriyadi said that sexual harassment was a “serious misconduct” in whatever shape or form, and “cannot be&amp;nbsp;tolerated”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perpetrators who go unpunished, will continue intimidating, humiliating and traumatising the victims thus resulting, at least, in an unhealthy working environment,” he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male appellant, then an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTH&lt;/span&gt; Risk Management Department general manager, had initially sued his female subordinate claiming that the sexual harassment complaint she lodged was defamatory towards him and was purportedly the reason why his work contract had not been&amp;nbsp;renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her submission, the victim had said that the appellant asked her to be his second wife, compared a man’s potency to coconuts and asked her if she preferred being in a relationship with married&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She subsequently counter-sued him for sexual harassment, claiming the incident had caused her serious emotional, mental stress and&amp;nbsp;trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inquiry set up by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTH&lt;/span&gt; afterwards found insufficient evidence to exact disciplinary action against the appellant, and he was slapped with only a strong reprimand from the firm’s human resource department, while the respondent was transferred to another&amp;nbsp;division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Court’s Justice Amelia Tee Abdullah in her decision on September 2012 had dismissed the appellant’s claim and allowed the respondent’s counterclaim, awarding her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM120&lt;/span&gt;,000 in total for&amp;nbsp;damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellant then appealed the case in the Court of Appeal, where a three-man panel led by Justice Datuk Zaharah Ibrahim on December last year also upheld the High Court judge’s&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are concerned of the manner in which this Private Members’ Bill was tabled in Parliament. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; urges the government and the other parties involved to give full regard to the democratic way which we must observe in putting forward any legislation, particularly where the public has significant&amp;nbsp;concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the level of debate this has generated in the public sphere, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; requests that any future tabling of this Private Members’ Bill or anything akin to it go through a thorough process which accords full and fair transparency and debate prior to its tabling in Parliament. It is our right as citizens of this country to be given our opportunity to present our views on a legislation that will have deep impact on our society in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, Syariah courts’ criminal jurisdiction is subject to limits imposed by federal law of a maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment, maximum fine of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM5000&lt;/span&gt; and whipping up to six strokes, often referred to as the ‘3:5:6 Rule’. This proposed amendment would now also allow Syariah Court judges to sentence whipping up to 100 strokes for accusations of engaging in illicit sex and up to 80 strokes for consumption of&amp;nbsp;alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although religious authorities in Malaysia are keen to stress that whippings under Syariah are ‘light’ and are not meant to hurt as whippings in our criminal justice system do inflict; it should be pointed out that this is a Malaysian interpretation. In Muslim-majority countries which have Syariah-sanctioned whippings, the same guarantee is not necessarily&amp;nbsp;present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are specifically concerned that the amendments may lead to a significant degradation of human rights. We are of the opinion that Syariah laws have been applied in a discriminatory fashion, often victimizing the minority sects of our&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are of the opinion that the role of the state in enforcing an individual’s practice of the Muslim faith needs to be urgently relooked to remove further abuses under the name of the religion. Increasing punishments will only place a temporary bandage on open wounds within the society and may cause more societal harm in the long&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, these disturbing developments do not uphold the compassionate and merciful nature of Islam (mawaddah wa rahmah) as it focuses merely on punishments with less to no room for forgiveness and repentance. The notion that these punishments absolve the alleged perpetrators of sins cannot be supported because punishments do not necessarily lead to restorative justice, not for the perpetrators and not for the&amp;nbsp;victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to amending the powers of Syariah courts, we urge the review of the Syariah Criminal Offences (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCO&lt;/span&gt;) laws of Malaysia. There needs to be a clear line on its jurisdictions and overhaul of laws that violate our fundamental liberties as enshrined under the federal constitution of&amp;nbsp;Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

He had set her alight after dousing her with petrol in their living room in front of their children. He claimed to have done so because she had refused to give him money to settle his gambling&amp;nbsp;debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Mohammad Affandi Ismail was propelled to infamy when a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCTV&lt;/span&gt; recording of him violently assaulting his wife in the presence of their two young children inside a hospital lift went viral. He stated in court that he had to teach her a lesson, as she had been disrespectful to him. Today, the Bukit Mertajam Magistrates Court found Mohammad Affandi guilty of domestic violence and sentenced him to eight months’&amp;nbsp;imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In domestic violence cases, children are often the forgotten victims. The children in both the above cases were exposed to escalated levels of violence inflicted by one of their parents on the other. When children in such cases have to go through the trial process, they should be provided every protection available under the law. This includes access to representation or a watching brief lawyer, and the opportunity to present their victim impact statement to the&amp;nbsp;court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witnessing acts of violence will undoubtedly deeply scar children. They may experience a range of emotions, including feeling scared, fearful, guilty, ashamed, sad, depressed or angry, and exhibit a variety of behaviours such as being aggressive, withdrawn, or even&amp;nbsp;self-harming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children in homes where domestic abuse occurs will usually witness frequent acts of violence over an extended period of time. This is because domestic violence is repetitive in nature and the victims are often unable to or do not seek help immediately. Repeated exposure to violence might lead children to normalize violent behaviour. As such, the long-term impact of a child’s exposure to domestic violence cannot be understated. According to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/span&gt;’s “Behind Closed Doors” report, &lt;em&gt;the single best predictor of children becoming either perpetrators or victims of domestic violence is whether they grow up in a home where there is domestic violence&lt;/em&gt;. A 2014 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; research indicated that boys who witness violence are twice as likely to abuse their partners in&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all children exposed to repeated acts of domestic violence grow up to be abusers. Some grow up to abhor violence, while others may become victims of abuse themselves. The same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/span&gt; report highlighted that children exposed to violence at home are 15 times more likely to be victims of physical or sexual assault. Research also suggests that girls who witness their mothers being beaten may be more accepting of violence in their&amp;nbsp;relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the two recent convictions uphold Malaysia’s clear stance in opposing domestic violence, the effect of domestic violence on children is generally ignored. In the last three years alone, there have been almost 14,000 reports of domestic violence nationwide. How many of these acts of violence were witnessed by children? How has it impacted them? We must recognise that domestic violence is learned behaviour that can persist from one generation to the next. We have a responsibility to provide effective intervention in cases of domestic violence not just for the adults involved, but for the children as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCC&lt;/span&gt; senior advocacy officer Melissa Mohd Akhir said members, including police and social welfare officers, should understand domestic violence laws, and the rights ofvictims to protection under the law, as well as undergo training to grasp and appreciate their roles in preventing domestic violence as laid out under the law and the Guidelines to Handling Domestic Violence&amp;nbsp;Cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reference to a High Court decision on Tuesday, which found former loan shark-turned-hawker Chiam Nguang Huat guilty of murdering his wife Lai Siew Fong in 2013, Melissa said the victim had made numerous police reports on the violence she had faced at the hands of her husband since September&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These reports made by her and her family members did not receive the appropriate attention, nor were the proper actions&amp;nbsp;taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="inlineAdMobile" &gt;
&lt;div id="div-gpt-ad-1459820957057-0" &gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inlineAd" &gt;
&lt;div id="inlineAd1" &gt;
&lt;div id="div-gpt-ad-1392882089877-0" &gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The failure of our enforcement agencies to intervene despite repeated reports of violence contributed to the further repetition and escalation of the violence, which ultimately resulted in Lai’s horrific&amp;nbsp;murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCC&lt;/span&gt; journeyed initially with the victim and later with her family throughout the police investigation and trial process,” she said in astatement on&amp;nbsp;Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa said despite the protections offered to domestic violence victims under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVA&lt;/span&gt; (Domestic Violence Act) 1994 and the recently launched Guidelines to Handling Domestic Violence Cases by the Ministry of Women, Family, and Community Development, domestic violencevictims often faced numerous difficulties in getting the help and protection they&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From our experience, many officers in enforcement agencies do not understand domestic violence, and do not know their duties as ascribed by the law or how to carry out those duties&amp;nbsp;effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Often, victims find theircomplaints not taken seriously by the very agencies whom they seek help&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While domestic violence has been legislated against, certain forms of it are still not recognised by enforcement officers as a crime,” she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa added that some victims were not informed about their rights, including access to protection orders while many officers in enforcement agencies “seem unaware” of their responsibilities, resulting in multiple instances where victims were not helped to obtain a protection order, or where the protection order was not delivered to the suspect&amp;nbsp;immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, she added, poorcommunication between the agencies could result in lack of protection of the victim, rendering them vulnerable to further and more severe abuse from the&amp;nbsp;perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has taken three years for Lai’s case to come to a&amp;nbsp;conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The case has had a profound and harrowing effect on her family, especially her children who witnessed the&amp;nbsp;crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To ensure that other women do not suffer the same fate as Lai Siew Fong, we need to act now to collectively overcome the inertia and apathy shown towards domestic violence and its victims,” she&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Chiam, 42, was sentenced to death by a High Court in George Town after he was found guilty of setting his wife on fire that resulted in her death about three years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;

We believe, based on reports of the proposed amendments and the escalating suppression of freedom of expression, that these amendments will have the impact of worsening the human rights situation on the ground for&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed amendments include mandatory registration of “political” bloggers and online news portals, and an increase in penalties for offences under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMA&lt;/span&gt;. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MCMC&lt;/span&gt;) will also potentially be accorded greater powers to take down online content and block&amp;nbsp;websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has provided new tools and platforms for women to express ideas and desires, connect with others like them, organise themselves to address injustices, as well as bypass some of the financial and social barriers against running businesses. However, in the context of entrenched conservatism and the politicisation of religion, Malaysian women’s behaviour online is already scrutinised and regulated by gendered norms. Women who are perceived to have “transgressed” routinely receive rape threats, and often their personal information online would be spread online to shame them. Regressive ideologies around women’s sexualities and gender expressions in particular are used to denigrate and silence&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed amendments will not address violence, discrimination and misogyny faced by women online. They will instead add to the threats faced by women who are speaking out on issues that matter to them, from democratic governance to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GST&lt;/span&gt; to their life choices. The idea that somehow the government could discern “political bloggers” from other bloggers, for example, is laughable. Malaysian women’s lives are political because even our identities are&amp;nbsp;politicised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has a vibrant online community of women who are content creators, fans, artists, bloggers, and activists. The chilling effect of the proposed amendments should not be under-estimated. It will drive many women who are already prone to self-censorship to suppress expressions of creativity and ideas, and withdraw from public discourse on issues that affect their&amp;nbsp;lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While human rights defenders and Opposition politicians have been the most visible victims of the current crackdown on freedom of expression, it will only be a matter of time before other groups are targeted. In the long term it will be women – especially the most marginalised and vulnerable among us – who will feel the adverse and most lasting&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Salleh Said Keruak has sought to give assurances that the amendments were not intended to “restrict people’s freedoms.” The Malaysian government should then release the full text of the proposed amendments so the public can judge for themselves, instead of keeping the amendments under&amp;nbsp;wraps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; urges the government to halt the tabling of the amendments until open and participatory consultations can be held with different and diverse stakeholders, including civil society organisations, to comprehensively examine the impact of the proposed amendments. We recall that the government held nationwide roadshows to consult the public before passing the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976 and the Domestic Violence Act&amp;nbsp;1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason why the tabling of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMA&lt;/span&gt; amendments cannot be delayed pending a public consultation, and a clearer definition of what harms these are meant to curtail. Any law that restricts our freedom of expression should be focused on setting the limits to the limitations, and not resort to authoritarian measures to expand these&amp;nbsp;limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

I am thankful for the unwavering support of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Exco. We have shared novel experiences as well as challenges which have taken us off the beaten path and beyond our usual comfort zones. It’s been an interesting journey.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For me personally, there were many firsts. I learnt how to draft my first press statement, spoke at my first press conference, attended meetings advocating for law reform with policy-makers (on the Domestic Violence Act and the Child Act) and chaired meetings comprising representatives from governmental and non-governmental agencies for the Child Sexual Abuse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOP&lt;/span&gt; project. I also observed the marvellous friendship and synergy of the women activists who make up the Joint Action Group for Gender Equality (“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”), a coalition of 12 women’s groups. They are tireless, strong and courageous. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I am grateful for dedication and commitment of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Exco. We work well as a team, with a shared passion to carry out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;’s main objectives. These include:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To promote and increase the participation of women in all levels of judicial, legal and public&amp;nbsp;institutions.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;To provide education, gender sensitization and awareness in legal and related&amp;nbsp;fields.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;To monitor laws, legislation, policies and practice directions and to advocate reforms that ensures promotion of equality and eradication of all forms of discrimination against&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;To promote the adoption and implementation of international human rights standards, principles and&amp;nbsp;norms.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;To provide a professional and social network for women lawyers and law graduates in&amp;nbsp;Malaysia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We draw our inspiration from those who have paved the way before us. Our founding members, Dato’ Noor Farida Ariffin (former Ambassador to the Hague and G25 spokesperson), Tan Sri Dato Seri Siti Norma Yaacob (our first woman Federal Court Judge) and Dato’ Ambiga Sreenivasan (former Malaysian Bar President and co-chairperson of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BERSIH&lt;/span&gt;, a coalition for free and fair elections). 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; is also fortunate to have the continuing support of three of our past Presidents, Ms Vicky Alahakone, Ms Foo Yet Ngo and immediate past-President, Ms Meera&amp;nbsp;Samanther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Over the past year, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; has concentrated on the areas of law reform, advocacy and outreach to the law colleges. It has been gratifying to see how each has taken form and the Annual Report has set out comprehensively the work that we have done so far. Today, I would like to highlight three projects:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;a) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Child Sexual Abuse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOP&lt;/span&gt; project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – From July 2015 to December, 2015, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; had collaborated with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCC&lt;/span&gt; Penang, various governmental agencies and Child NGOs to identify gaps in the legal system and support services with the aim of creating a working together document/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOP&lt;/span&gt; on handling children involved in suspected child abuse/child sexual abuse. In January, 2016, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; submitted a concept paper to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YBGK&lt;/span&gt; (the National Legal Aid Foundation), seeking to extend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YBGK&lt;/span&gt; support for victims of child sexual abuse, human-trafficking and domestic violence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As a natural progression, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; is currently working on forming a team of lawyers to provide watching brief support for survivors of child sexual abuse, to increase their access to justice, provide them with a voice and to alleviate re-traumatisation caused by the legal process. We have recently recruited six lawyers trained in “Child Representation skills” to be part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSA&lt;/span&gt; team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;b) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Human trafficking project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; had organised a series of talks to raise awareness and field trips to better understand the needs of human-trafficking survivors:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;27th January, 2015: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Activist Series: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal Case Management Support for Victims of Human Trafficking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” by Daniel&amp;nbsp;Lo;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;18th February, 2015: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNY&lt;/span&gt; visit to the&amp;nbsp;shelter;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;12th August, 2015: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Activist Series “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capacity Building for Lawyers to work with Victims of Human Trafficking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” by Anderson Selvasegaram and Tharini Cecil of Suka Society, Goh Siu Lin and Daniel&amp;nbsp;Lo&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;7th November, 2015: Deepavali visit to the&amp;nbsp;shelter;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;16th December, 2015: X’mas visit to the&amp;nbsp;shelter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Originally, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; aimed to work with the relevant NGOs to provide victim-centred legal services, such as pamphlets or videos on FAQs (legal process/ immigration/ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATIPSOM&lt;/span&gt;/ compensation). However, this project has to be put on hold due to events beyond our control.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;c &lt;strong&gt;)  &lt;u&gt;The Gender Equality Initiative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a collaboration between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;, the Malaysian Bar and local private law colleges. Its aim is to create greater awareness amongst law students on gender equality. Last year’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; highlighted issues arising from &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gender Discrimination within the Learning Environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;and was very well received by the law students. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; appears to have taken a life of its own with more and more private law colleges and non-law colleges wanting to jump on board.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For 2016, the theme “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women in Leadership Positions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;” was selected, casting a spotlight on the challenges that women face when climbing up the corporate ladder, particularly the impact of gender stereotyping and gender discrimination. The statistics reveal that women are severely under-represented at the top levels of all sectors. We need to close this gender gap, break down the barriers to leadership and enhance opportunities for women to advance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This year’s colloquium will take place on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June, 2016&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at Inti College. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEI&lt;/span&gt; colloquium has been ably led by Meera Samanther, Santhi Latha and Ida Daniella Zulkifili. Thank you! &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why do we need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I now move on to address a question which I frequently hear when I invite lawyers to become members of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;.  Many have questioned the need for a society dedicated to women lawyers and law students.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;To this, I say that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; provides a valuable platform for women lawyers to speak with a collective voice in a supportive environment. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; provides greater visibility to advocate for focused change on issues that impact us as women lawyers as well as on laws that impact women and children generally.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; has the potential for a diverse and rich membership base for professional networking and support. In the months to come, we hope to hold networking luncheons for members. I have recently spoken to the “Gender and Inclusive Head” of an international bank to speak at our inaugural lunch networking luncheon. So, stay tuned for more details!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In addition, to showcase the professional capabilities of women lawyers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; has in collaboration with the Kuala Lumpur Bar, organised a forum titled“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women in Arbitration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”. Three women practitioners of differing seniority are featured, they are, Ms Tan Swee Imm, Ms Elaine Yap (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; member) and Ms Sharon Chong. So do pencil in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of August 2016&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; into your diaries and give them your fullest support. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I hope to see more members coming forward to work with us in making a difference as we continue to push the boundaries for women’s equality and advancement both in the legal and non-legal spheres. To end, let me quote the inspirational words of my favourite “badass” feminist, Supreme Court justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who when asked as to how she would like to be remembered, said:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone who used whatever talent she had to do her work to the very best of her ability. And to help repair tears in her society, to make things a little better through the use of whatever ability she has. To do something&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.. outside myself. &amp;#8216;Cause I&amp;#8217;ve gotten much more satisfaction for the things that I&amp;#8217;ve done for which I was not paid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goh Siu Lin&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are especially concerned as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDRM&lt;/span&gt; is a federal body and the allocation of federal resources for a state religious body reflects grave misplacement of&amp;nbsp;priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the deployment of police officers at Jais may seem like an effort to increase accountability and professionalism of the religious authorities, this pilot project would likely only focus on the implementation of the Selangor Syariah Criminal Offences Enactment specifically on moral policing, with little attention given to the laws themselves and their impact on our fundamental&amp;nbsp;liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t federal resources be better spent on tackling issues of gender-based violence rather than moral&amp;nbsp;policing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Malaysian government’s Millennium Development Goals Report 2015, in 2014, there were 3,545 reported cases of domestic violence and 2,045 reported cases of&amp;nbsp;rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind that these statistics are just of reported cases, resources should be allocated for sufficient numbers of police officers, as well as for their training to ensure proper investigation and victim&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying police officers to One Stop Crisis Centres (all under one roof place for domestic violence cases in hospitals) and remote districts in Sabah to help more women and children benefit from the Domestic Violence Act is an example of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDRM&lt;/span&gt;’s resources could be better&amp;nbsp;utilised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDRM&lt;/span&gt;’s involvement should not be a backdoor means of legitimising Jais’&amp;nbsp;activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase professionalism of Jais&amp;nbsp;officers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger enforcement issue should be in ensuring Jais’ compliance to the rule of law, including implementing procedural laws and standard operating procedures applicable before, and during and after raids and arrests, which, reportedly have failed to be addressed&amp;nbsp;adequately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, raids have resulted in fatalities, yet religious authorities have not been held&amp;nbsp;accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater accountability on the part of public institutions such as Jais can be achieved by enhancing the ability of citizens to scrutinise the use of public funds and to engage with the authorities in a dialogue on how taxpayers want their money to be&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, monitoring and conducting due diligence on the impact of Jais’ activities must be&amp;nbsp;implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly urge Jais to prioritise increasing the professionalism of their officials through robust, consistent and effective training programs at their national training centre or Institute Latihan Islam Malaysia (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ILIM&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any action taken by Jais or any enforcement agency must be guided by principles of justice, by focusing on due diligence, sensitivity, and compliance with syariah procedural laws.and&amp;nbsp;compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; has long urged the government to establish laws and policies that are compliant with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (Cedaw), and to stay the course in improving women’s human&amp;nbsp;rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reiterate that it is not the role of the state to regulate personal lives in Malaysia, nor is it the true purpose of&amp;nbsp;syariah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is indeed a significant moment for child rights in Malaysia, in line with the spirit and intent of the said Article 15A while upholding Malaysia’s obligations under Article 7 the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the Child on the right of every child to acquire a&amp;nbsp;nationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Navin was born in this country to a Malaysian father and Filipino mother. He had endured a 3 year legal battle seeking Malaysian citizenship after his father’s two earlier applications to the Home Ministry for his son’s Malaysian citizenship were consecutively rejected in 2011 and&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first application was rejected on the ground that his parents’ marriage was not registered under our Law Reform (Marriage &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Divorce) Act 1976 whereas his second application was rejected without any reasons being&amp;nbsp;provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; would like to highlight the following four considerations specified in the Court of Appeal Order to guide the Home Ministry when evaluating an application made under Article 15A of the Federal&amp;nbsp;Constitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span &gt;The Court of Appeal further directed the Home Ministry to arrive at its decision within six months of 29 July 2015, before M. Navin’s 18th birthday.&lt;/span&gt;a) the person is under the age of 21 years who has no parents;&lt;br/&gt;
b) the person who has a connection with the country;&lt;br/&gt;
c) cases that would result in hardship;&lt;br/&gt;
d) the best interests of the&amp;nbsp;child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, applicants who have submitted similar Article 15A applications for citizenship have been informed that a decision would take two years to be made. Such a period is too long for a stateless child, a persona non grata who is placed in an extremely vulnerable position, deprived of basic human rights, education and subject to&amp;nbsp;exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Association of Women Lawyers welcomes the Federal Court’s decision which has reaffirmed the legal position&lt;a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the civil courts retain sole jurisdiction over the dissolution of a non-muslim&amp;nbsp;marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court had clarified that upon dissolution of a civil marriage, all ancillary reliefs and consequential orders remained within the exclusive purview of the civil court, including that of custody. The Syariah Court custody order which was made in excess of jurisdiction was thus&amp;nbsp;set-aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court had interviewed the children and following this, the original High Court custody order was varied splitting custody of the 8 year old son to the father and the 11 year old girl to the mother. It was reported that the Federal Court had made such a decision after having taken into account the wishes expressed by the children&lt;a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Deepa S. had lodged more than 7 police reports from 2007 to 2012&lt;a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for acts of domestic violence committed against her by her former spouse and was granted an interim protection order&lt;a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against him in August&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be pertinent to highlight that child custody in other jurisdictions such as the United States of America, have changed their basis of evaluation for child custody/visitation decisions particularly where domestic violence is involved. Many American states now recognise exposure to domestic violence&lt;a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as one of the factors used to determine a child’s best&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Model Code of the Family Violence Project of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCFCJ&lt;/span&gt;, 1998)&lt;/u&gt; states that there is a &amp;#8220;&amp;#8221;&lt;em&gt;rebuttable presumption that it is detrimental to the child and &lt;strong&gt;not in the best interest of the child to be placed in sole custody, joint legal custody, or joint physical custody with the perpetrator of family violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;. The Code heavily emphasises the safety and well-being of the child and the parent-survivor. “&lt;em&gt;The perpetrator&amp;#8217;s history of causing fear as well as physical harm should be considered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;it is in the b &lt;strong&gt;est interest of the child to reside with the non-violent parent&lt;/strong&gt; and that this parent should be able to choose the location of the residence, even if it is in another state&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superior status of the unimpeachable parent was given recognition in an earlier Federal Court case of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Manickam v. Intherahnee [1984] 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNS&lt;/span&gt; 90; [1985] 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MLJ&lt;/span&gt; 5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which dealt with the issue of custody over a child 8 years of age. In considering Section 88(2)(b) of the  Law Reform (Marriage &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Divorce) Act 1976, the Court had&amp;nbsp;held:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“..&lt;em&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;rule laid down for my guidance in the exercise of responsible jurisdiction does not state that the welfare of the infant is to be the sole consideration but the paramount consideration&lt;/strong&gt;, it necessarily &lt;strong&gt;contemplates the existence of other conditions, and amongst these the &lt;u&gt;wishes of an unimpeachable parent undoubtedly stand first.&lt;/u&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be timely for Malaysia to implement legal reform and structural changes to keep abreast of legal developments in the area of domestic violence and custodial rights. Some recommendations include inter&amp;nbsp;alia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol &gt;&lt;li&gt;legislative reform to adopt the legal presumption of guardianship and custody in favour of the non-violent&amp;nbsp;spouse;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the establishment of visitation centres with security, closely coordinated by the family courts / relevant governmental agencies to facilitate safe access for families torn apart by domestic violence or for high-conflict&amp;nbsp;marriages;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In more complex custodial matters, it may be appropriate to appoint a guardian ad litem&lt;a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to represent the interests of the children. Some examples that may necessitate the appointment of a guardian ad litem include, serious allegations of domestic violence/child abuse, children being torn apart by allegiance by one or both parents and serious imbalance of power between the&amp;nbsp;parents;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the appointment of neutral custody evaluators to identify the presence of domestic violence/abuse and the extent of its severity and past and potential effects on the children of the marriage and to the non-violent&amp;nbsp;spouse;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precautionary measures may also included into the custody order to address the potential dangers of continuing contact between the violent and non-violent spouse. For example, requiring the violent spouse to undergo relevant anger management/“batterer’s treatment programme”, substance abuse treatment, the imposition of anti-molestation orders to protect the non-violent spouse/children. It may also be provided that the non-violent spouse should not be expected to meet with the abuser and for non-disclosure of the children/non-violent spouse’s personal information which may compromise safety of the children/non-violent&amp;nbsp;spouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is hoped that such measures would in some part alleviate the continued domestic violence / abuse of women and children post-divorce and to avoid the separation of children from their loving and non-violent&amp;nbsp;parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal system should not be used  by abusive spouses as a tool to further violate the human rights of abused mothers and&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;

Such conversions were effected in defiance of the rules of natural justice, particularly where the children were born of a non-muslim&amp;nbsp;marriage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; January,&amp;nbsp;2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent court of appeal decision in the Indira Gandhi case has cast a shadow over the rights of a non-muslim parent in a custodial&amp;nbsp;dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By subterfuge, Indira’s husband had unilaterally converted the children to the Islamic faith, without her and the children’s presence, knowledge and consent and later secured a custody order from the Syariah court. Such conversions were effected in defiance of the rules of natural justice, particularly where the children were born of a non-muslim&amp;nbsp;marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a non-muslim couple contract a marriage, they would assume that their rights would be in accordance with the matrimonial law under which they were married. This has the merit of being just and equitable and does no injustice to any of the&amp;nbsp;parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the right of a parent to determine his/her child’s religion, the purposive interpretation of the singular term “&lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt;” in &lt;u&gt;Article 12(4) of the Federal Constitution&lt;/u&gt; would include the plural and the equality of parental rights is provided for under &lt;u&gt;Section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants’ Act 1961&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 cabinet directive is reflective of this position as is the proposal by the Negeri Sembilan state government of 2015&lt;a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; “….&lt;em&gt; to introduce and enforce new regulations ensuring that those who wish to convert to Islam dissolve their marriage prior to conversion, and make a statutory declaration on their conversion to Islam&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This human tragedy that has befallen Indira Gandhi has dragged on for too long and further lost in the maze of litigation is the voice of her youngest&amp;nbsp;child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, Malaysia ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child (“&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt;”), of relevance are &lt;u&gt;Articles 2&lt;a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;[2]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 3&lt;a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;[3]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/u&gt;which provide that the State in all actions concerning children are to act in the “&lt;em&gt;best interests of the child and which shall be the primary consideration&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guided by the aforesaid &lt;u&gt;Articles 2 and 3&lt;/u&gt;, has Malaysia discharged its international obligations under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRC&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it in the best interests of a breastfed infant to be torn away unceremoniously from her mother? Was any consideration accorded to the High Court finding of Justice Wan Afrah&lt;a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; that their mother was able to provide a more stable home life as compared to the converted&amp;nbsp;father?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Indira’s rights as a mother provided due protection under Article 8(2) of the Federal Constitution that she be not discriminated against on the basis of gender and&amp;nbsp;religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions illustrate the urgent need for constitutional and legislative amendments to expressly stipulate that a non-Muslim child born of a non-muslim marriage, may only be converted with the consent of both parents. Additionally, all issues relating to the non-muslim marriage should be resolved in the civil courts and the said marriage may only be dissolved in the civil courts before a converting spouse may be permitted to&amp;nbsp;remarry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the equality that Malaysian women are striving for, side by side with Ms Indira&amp;nbsp;Gandhi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;em&gt;Equality of Opportunity and Equality of Results: The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt; Framework. The Convention on the on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt;) provides a unique set of standards for the realisation of the human rights of women. Its main intention is the dual agenda of the elimination of discrimination against women and the fulfillment of women’s right to equality. While law and policy measures have been in place at the domestic level, with the intention of eliminating discrimination on the basis of sex, legal frameworks for the fulfillment of women’s right to equality have been inadequate.  This speaks to the classic dichotomy between ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ duties of the State. Besides, the legal norms at domestic level have also been supportive of a dichotomy between what realms can and should be regulated and what should not be regulated, compelling the State to take a laissez faire attitude in certain contexts. This is the other dichotomy between the private and public spheres. These norms and legal traditions are in conflict with State obligations under &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt; and its principle of substantive equality. The presentation will discuss these conflicts and provide illustrations of the obligations of the State under &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt; using its jurisprudence emerging from the cases brought by women to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt; under its Optional&amp;nbsp;Protocol.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, news on human trafficking has been dominating our local headlines. Many lawyers may want to help but do not know&amp;nbsp;how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently a gap in providing legal aid / assistance to victims of human trafficking as the reach of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YBGK&lt;/span&gt; at the moment extends mostly to defendants in criminal proceedings&amp;nbsp;only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, after being found, trafficking victims are brought to government-approved shelters (although there are proposed amendments to the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act that would allow them to be housed in specified &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt;-run shelters as well) where they are held as part of a court-ordered protection measure that lasts up to 90 days (but this could be&amp;nbsp;extended). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the 2014 Trafficking in Persons (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIP&lt;/span&gt;) report released by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; State Department, in the past year, in Malaysia, there were 89 investigations under Human Trafficking compared to 190, and 9 convictions of traffickers compared to 21 in the previous year. The majority of victims are women who need to be advised on their&amp;nbsp;rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDC&lt;/span&gt; is collaborating with the Association of Women Lawyers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;), Anderson Selvasegaram and Tharini Cecil of Suka Society and Mr. Daniel Lo of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Department on an upcoming workshop to teach basic interviewing skills and on how to provide basic advice to these victims. The areas covered&amp;nbsp;are: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• How to give legal advice to a victim of human&amp;nbsp;trafficking? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• What are their legal&amp;nbsp;needs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• How can you help&amp;nbsp;them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDC&lt;/span&gt; would like encourage lawyers to come forward to assist anti-trafficking NGOs with capacity building and legal work. Please take the first step by attending the upcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; Activist Workshop which will be based on case studies. You will be taken through a mock interview and participating NGOs (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;, Suka Society and Tenaganita) will be on site to provide their feedback as well as share their&amp;nbsp;perspectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please save the date: 12th August 2015 (Wednesday), 2:30 to 4:30pm at the KLBar Auditorium, Wisma&amp;nbsp;Hangsam.&lt;/p&gt;

For example:a) the section in its current form, fails to recognise that rape is a crime involving an act of sexual violence without the victim&amp;#8217;s consent. There are instances where marital rape occurs in the absence of any visible signs of injury on the victim as the perpetrator may resort to other forms of coercion (e.g. economic, emotional threats, blackmail etc).b) it should also be highlighted that the prescribed punishment under Section 375A is imprisonment up to 5 years - extremely mild when&amp;nbsp;compared&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; is of the view that Section 375A of the Penal Code is deficient for many reasons.

&lt;div class="text_exposed_show" &gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;If Section 375 and Section 375A were meant to be the same animal under the guise of a different term, then why is there an apparent and gross disparity in sentencing&amp;nbsp;guidelines??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;Why is the offence of marital rape not stigmatised in the same manner as the other categories of rape under S375? Why should rape in a marital relationship be punished less severely? Does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;S375A&lt;/span&gt; send a sufficiently strong message of condemnation of the act of marital&amp;nbsp;rape?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;These are but a few questions for each of us to consider when evaluating whether or not the existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;S375A&lt;/span&gt; is adequate in providing deterrence and justice to victims of marital&amp;nbsp;rape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;The theme of this debate competition is &amp;#8216;gender equality&amp;#8217;, which encompasses issues such as:-&lt;br/&gt;
i) gender based discrimination at the workplace, politics and in the education system;&lt;br/&gt;
ii) discrimination against people who identify themselves as lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;br/&gt;
iii) the difference between sex and gender; and&lt;br/&gt;
iv) feminism in the modern&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;span &gt;A total of 8 teams participated in the Debate Competition, which saw the students arguing on 3&amp;nbsp;motions:-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was reported that the Minister in the Prime Minister&amp;#8217;s Department, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YB&lt;/span&gt; Nancy Shukri had in her parliamentary written reply, confirmed the retention of the exception under Section 375 of the Penal Code, relating to marital&amp;nbsp;rape.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10th June,&amp;nbsp;2015 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;’s Press Statement – on the need to criminalise marital rape &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We refer to the news item carried by the Malaysiakini news portal dated 10.6.2015. It was reported that the Minister in the Prime Minister&amp;#8217;s Department, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YB&lt;/span&gt; Nancy Shukri had in her parliamentary written reply, confirmed the retention of the exception under Section 375 of the Penal Code, relating to marital&amp;nbsp;rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effectively means that sexual intercourse between a husband and wife &lt;u&gt;without her consent&lt;/u&gt;, is not considered rape in this&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; is most disappointed by this regressive stance taken by the Government in refusing to criminalise marital rape. This is contrary to the recommendations of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEDAW&lt;/span&gt; committee of 2006 on Malaysia, i.e:”&lt;em&gt;The Committee requests the State party to enact legislation criminalizing marital rape, defining such rape on the basis of lack of consent of the wife.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysia’s position on marital rape is in stark contrast to 52 other nations, including Turkey, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United States of America which have legislated to make marital rape an offence (See &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; Report Annexure 4: “The 2011 Progress of the World’s Women: In Pursuit of Justice&amp;nbsp;Report”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The said 2011 Report also made reference to the authority of &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meera Dhungana on behalf of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FWLD&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; In that case, the Nepalese Supreme Court had the occasion to hear a case brought by the Forum for Women, Law and Development (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FWLD&lt;/span&gt;). It was ground-breaking for having invalidated the provision of the criminal code that exempted husbands from being charged with the rape of their wives. The court in rejecting the Government’s argument that outlawing marital rape would offend Hindu beliefs, also ended the conflict between the country’s Muluki Ain civil code, based on Hindu religious principles, and the 1990 Constitution, which pledges to end all forms of gender discrimination. The Nepalese Supreme Court stated most succinctly the essence of rape and why it should be&amp;nbsp;criminalised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Sexual intercourse in conjugal life is a normal course of behaviour, which must be based on consent. No religion may ever take it [marital rape] as lawful because the aim of a good religion is not to hate or cause loss to&amp;nbsp;anyone.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of rape stems from the issue of &lt;u&gt;lack of consent&lt;/u&gt; in a relationship where parties are of unequal bargaining power, powerfully illustrated by the prevalence of child marriages in this country, coupled with the inter-sectionality of poverty and lack of&amp;nbsp;education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marriage certificate cannot be a licence for forced sex. The assumption that a wife implicitly consents to all sexual activity is discriminatory of women. We urge the Honourable Minister to reconsider her&amp;nbsp;stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goh Siu&amp;nbsp;Lin &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good&amp;nbsp;Afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be wondering, and rightly so – why is there an organization specifically for Women Lawyers, when the Malaysian Bar caters for all lawyers – male and female&amp;nbsp;lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, women lawyers represent 51 % of the Malaysian Bar. So statistically , this validates the position that the representation of women in the legal profession is fair&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in reality is there a level playing field? Is it a fair playing field for women&amp;nbsp;lawyers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the Association of Women Lawyers Baseline survey was “51% - Is it a level playing field?”. The survey   was launched last mid year. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative survey on the working conditions of male and female lawyers in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; and Selangor in collaboration with the Bar, Suhakam and Women’s Aid Organisation. The researchers involved on this collaboration were from the Gender Studies Department and the Law Faculty of University Malaya&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of a survey only surfaced after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; held a brainstorming session with its members about 4 years ago.  Some of the younger lawyers shared with us about the sexual harassment cases they knew of and the intimidation some of them had experienced.  Most of us as senior lawyers knew or heard of such cases during our early years in practice but it was never brought up to the&amp;nbsp;Bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the brainstorming session, members also spoke about how they were encouraged by their lecturers, from one particular university,  to steer towards a path in conveyancing and family law, as apparently it best suited a women’s&amp;nbsp;lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such findings, our initial idea of a survey just on sexual harassment was scrapped but we broadened the survey to look at why women lawyers face unique challenges in their career. The study focused on direct and indirect discrimination. Indirect discrimination occurs when demands are made of employees that are not cognizant of the various social expectations placed on&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe there has never been any survey or analysis of how women have progressed in the profession in Malaysia.  We know there have been many rising stars and some who have been and are somewhat legendary in the legal circles – to name a few, we have Tan Sri Siti Norma Yaakob – former Federal Court Judge, Dato’ Noor Faridah (who is leading the G26,  a former Ambassador and former Sessions Court Judge) and Dato Ambiga (and who are all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt; members too) . We are extremely proud of these individuals. But we felt that we also needed to look at the landscape of all female&amp;nbsp;lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey raised many issues and provided much needed data that points to the uneven playing field for women in the legal profession.  Some of the questions posed were: Are women represented equally in leadership position within the Bar? Of the 15 members of the Bar Council Committee, only 5 are women. Of the past 28 Bar Presidents, only 2 have been women. The Constitution of Committee members of the various State Bars also show that women are under&amp;nbsp;represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey also indicated the existence of barriers of upward mobility that affect women. The different areas of practice also revealed a delineation of areas by gender and current social&amp;nbsp;expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repression or suppression of women is not something new that only affects the legal profession. Gender Discrimination exists in most&amp;nbsp;professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender Inequality - So where does it stem from? Well I’m not going to have a discussion now as I’m excitedly waiting for the answers from our participants&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I end, I must thank Ms Santhi Latha, the representative from the Bar and Jian also from the Bar . Santhi and I had brainstormed this project sometime last year . My initial discussion with Santhi was on trying to introduce a compulsory Gender Sensitization Curriculum for all chambering students entering the legal profession. Well I think it’s too late for the older lawyers so the next best step I thought was working with chambering&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think working with Law students was even a better idea and a great privilege. I am honored to have been working with Taylors, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTI&lt;/span&gt; College, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KDU&lt;/span&gt; since last year.  I must also thank Mr Harmahinder and Ms Tamara, and her colleagues from Taylors for kick starting the Gender Initiative project today. Thank you&amp;nbsp;Taylors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next competition would be held on the 16 June where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTI&lt;/span&gt; International University will be hosting the Debate Competition. The Video Competition hosted by the Bar will be sometime in July, followed by the Moots, hosted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATC&lt;/span&gt; sometime end of August/ early September. Then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAC&lt;/span&gt; will host the Final closing ceremony in September. In future we hope to include the public Universities in this&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students – You are the future generation that can change the landscape of Human Rights, in particular Women’s Rights. It needs the efforts of Men and Women together to end Gender Discrimination. You need to be part of the&amp;nbsp;Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this Colloquium will set the context and train young legal minds to be more respectful and sensitive to the opposite sex and people of different sexual&amp;nbsp;orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you and all the best to the&amp;nbsp;participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div &gt;The colloquium comprised of 2 parts, the written research paper as well as the oral presentation. Each participant was evaluated on factors which include research, the content of their presentation and the effectiveness of the message that they tried to bring across.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div &gt;The competition at Taylor&amp;#8217;s University began at 2.00p.m. wherein 8 participants from the collaborating institutions delivered their presentations on issues relating to gender discrimination such as lack of access to education for young girls and discrimination against transgender athletes in schools. The participants demonstrated a high level of dedication and genuine passion towards their research. They also managed to handle the Question &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Answer session with poise and confidence despite being bombarded with difficult questions from the audience. The winners of the competition are:-&lt;/div&gt;

It is indeed a great honor to be standing here before all of you and especially to be seated with one of my former teachers Ms Moey . She was an icon at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBGS&lt;/span&gt; and loved by all of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Moey had very eloquently informed you about my work with the women’s movement and the years spent working on human rights, in particular women’s&amp;nbsp;rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let me share with you the many challenges that I had faced and how these challenges molded me and strengthened me to become who I have become&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my parents, education was an all-important factor, whether you are a girl or a boy. I was the only girl amongst 3 brothers, whom I adored. My parents treated me as “ the special one” being the only girl. So I was given every opportunity in education. But there was always something nagging me all the time, which I could not put my finger to. There were always cultural inhibitions placed on me as a girl. It was always an effort to stand up against these restrictions. At that time, I could not articulate it as discrimination but I knew then that it did not sit well with me. Perhaps, unconsciously that was the start of my training ground, which set the base of my future&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schooling years at Bukit Bintang Girls school was awesome for me. Till today, I love to belt out my school anthem, to the shock and horror of my 3 children, who cannot fathom the way I love reciting the lyrics to them. Now, what do I remember learning from school days, apart from remembering the choral speaking competitions? It’s not so much the history, or the geography or the science or the maths. Apologies to the teachers here before me. It’s the moral values that stick in my head. The values I learnt from my elders and also from my peers are embedded in&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 17, I left for boarding school in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and for some reason my parents enrolled me in an all-boys boarding school with 28 girls. The transition was not easy for me for the first month. Cried everyday, wanting to come home. Being in a foreign country, the cold weather, only Malaysian and yes so many boys to deal with and adjusting to school food was difficult.  I had no choice but to adjust. I had to buck up and kept telling myself surely it will get better. And it did get better once I started making friends, once I got comfortable adjusting to the teaching methods, the weather. I settled well. Being away, made me become independent at a young age and I drew strength from&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took part in most of the activities – football, netball, squash , tennis , archery , rifle shooting, horse – riding and the school choir. We had church service every morning before school commenced. Being brought up as a Hindu, my parents did not exempt me from church service, although they were given the option. They believed that moral lessons taught from any religious denomination were good for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my second year at boarding school, I was elected as the Netball captain and Deputy Head of the School and that was my starting point of building on my leadership&amp;nbsp;qualities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then pursued my Law degree at uni and obtained my Masters in Law. Taking part in moot competitions taught me how to project my voice and articulate my thoughts. At uni, I had a few relationships. How I wish someone had told me then, that the first guy you meet and fall in love is not the one you are going to marry!! A note to all of you being &amp;#8220;in a relationship&amp;#8221; in Uni and carrying it through to your working life is a whole different ball game . I am sure parents sitting here can resonate with this. The goal post shifts for both parties . Well most of the&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; did I return home to&amp;nbsp;Malaysia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple – I returned home because my then boy friend wanted to return home. It was such a lame reason to return home. But that is the truth. But I know &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt; that I made the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt; decision for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WRONG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst working as a young lawyer,  we face all kinds of challenges at the work place. I concentrated on my career, trying to find myself. As many working women, be it in the legal profession or any other profession, as women we are exposed to all sorts of challenges based on our gender . Women are often told that you need to balance your working life with home life. It&amp;#8217;s best to steer into the area of practice that will best suit you since you are going to get married and have kids. Well we don’t hear such messages being breathed down the boys, do we? . Statements like these undermine the ability of women to spread their wings and it did not sit well with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 12 years in practice , I joined the Women’s Aid Organisation. It was pure chance that led me to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAO&lt;/span&gt; or perhaps someone guided me there. I had a complicated pregnancy and a hectic litigation schedule was not conducive for my well being. I thought I would just take a short&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My world literally opened up for me after joining &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAO&lt;/span&gt;. I met so many women and children who had endured so much pain and suffering, having left their abusive partners, having left their homes and having to stay in a shelter in secrecy. The children could not go to school as they were all in hiding and the decision whether to lodge a police report against their spouse for domestic violence is a terrifying decision. The people who volunteered and worked at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAO&lt;/span&gt; were making a difference in their own lives and the lives of others. They lobbied for changes in the laws and polices that discriminated women. They counseled the women that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; one deserved to be battered and it was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; their&amp;nbsp;fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My world of Feminism took a steep learning curve. Feminism is about Justice and Equality. I knew then, that this was my calling. I was led here to do something. I returned to practice only to do legal work on Human Rights , in particular Women’s&amp;nbsp;Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great things are not reserved for just special people. It exists in you and me. We are all born leaders. We do not need titles to be a leader. I worked with the qualities I possessed . My legal background was put to good use. I pushed my boundaries, took risks and challenged&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAO&lt;/span&gt; and the Association of Women Lawyers, I did not set out to be a leader. I joined as any volunteer who believed in their values of advocating for women’s&amp;nbsp;rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to get involved in my home country. I knew that the change has to start with me. I cannot wait for others to do it. For those reasons, I am involved with the Bersih’s civil society movement of&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came home to Malaysia for the wrong reason but I know now it was the right&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People may influence you. The grass will always look greener somewhere else.   Folks - the grass is only green because someone nurtured it, someone tended to it and made it&amp;nbsp;green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; challenge to all of you here is - Do you have it in you to make your grass green here in&amp;nbsp;Malaysia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I end – I want to share with you 5 pointers I wish someone had told me when I was your&amp;nbsp;age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold tight to your real friends and don’t forget the closeness that you feel&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be smart but your brains aren’t done with maturing yet. Listen to your parents more than you want to. Your brains have not connected all the dots&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can say No to sexual contact. You &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWN&lt;/span&gt; your body. Walking away is tough but your inner spirit will thank&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust the calling in your&amp;nbsp;heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to be the best &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;, not a copy of someone&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the measure of a person is not how much money you make, what car you drive or the fancy titles to your name or letters after your name. It is your values, your compassion and what you do to make your world, your Malaysia a better&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the points made was that women should cover themselves up to avoid sexual harassment and abuse by men (Wanita hendaklah menutup aurat supaya terhindar daripada gangguan seksual dan penganiayaan oleh lelaki yang tidak bermaruah dan&amp;nbsp;bermoral).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 25 years &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; has worked on the issue of preventing violence against women including sexual violence, be it directly with survivors or through legislative reform. The reality on the ground is simply that no woman or child is safe from rape or other forms of sexual&amp;nbsp;violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hundreds of survivors we have worked with over the years are mainly women and children from different age groups, religious and ethnic backgrounds, nationalities, disabilities and socio-economic&amp;nbsp;backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiences as well as research into rape show that perpetrators of sexual assault choose their victims based on opportunity (i.e., no one around, no one to stop them) and victim vulnerability (i.e., unable to assert themselves, or fight back, unable to report, no one will believe the&amp;nbsp;victim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well-known among those working with victims of sexual violence that modest dressing will not prevent a sexual assault. There are examples all over the world including Malaysia where women and girls, (and also men and boys), are sexually violated irrespective of what they may be&amp;nbsp;wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because sexual violence is not about sex but about an abuse of power and the intention to control and humiliate the victim. Sexual violence occurs not because of what a victim wears or looks like but because perpetrators choose to abuse the power they have over their&amp;nbsp;victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When modest dressing is promoted as a means to prevent sexual assault, it firstly lulls women into a false sense of security. This is dangerous as women need accurate information to protect themselves. Secondly it encourages victim blaming and in effect will stop victims from seeking the help and support they need because of the fear of being blamed or not being&amp;nbsp;believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it removes the responsibility of the assault from the perpetrator who in actual fact should be held accountable for his deliberate actions and not the victim. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YB&lt;/span&gt; Chong Eng’s statement on this issue reiterates &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt;’s concern that victims should not be blamed and there needs to be greater understanding on the&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAG&lt;/span&gt; welcomes all efforts to put an end to sexual violence against women and children. However we need to address the root causes which give rise to the culture of sexual violence in the country. The way forward should include addressing the culture where male aggression and violence against women is encouraged; where violence is increasingly sexualised; where women are objectified and dehumanised; and where survivors are blamed and perpetrators are&amp;nbsp;excused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey towards ending sexual violence and supporting victims to access redress is a long one. We all need to be moving&amp;nbsp;forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

9 February 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Persatuan Kesedaran Komuniti Selangor (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMPOWER&lt;/span&gt;) is appalled to read that the Selangor Islamic Religious Department (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAIS&lt;/span&gt;) has released a Friday sermon claiming that women covering their “aurat” would prevent rape. Once again, rape victims are blamed while rapists are absolved of responsibility over their actions.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
It is mind-boggling that a public institution like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAIS&lt;/span&gt; continues to openly perpetuate rape myths without any indication that it has done due diligence on its assertions in the sermon. Even a cursory reading of research into sexual assault would show that women’s dressing is not the cause of rape. The roots of rape lie in misogyny and the dynamics of an unequal power relationship between men and women, where women are seen as objects that need to be controlled and dominated.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately, the Malaysian Police no longer releases statistics on rape to the public, and women’s groups who managed to obtain those statistics are forbidden from sharing them openly. However, available data refutes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAIS&lt;/span&gt;’s assertions.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
In a majority of cases (3,462 out of 4,586 reported rape cases in 2007), the perpetrator is known to the victim. These perpetrators include fathers and male relatives who would be considered “muhrim”. How would covering up protect women and girls in this situation?&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
A disproportionate number of rape victims are children, rather than the mythical stereotype of scantily-clad women perpetuated by the sermon. In 2010, in about half of all reported rape cases, the victims were children under the age of 16. Will &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAIS&lt;/span&gt; insist on blaming the victims over their dressing too? What about boys who are raped – how would &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAIS&lt;/span&gt; suggest they be dressed “appropriately”?&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The harsh reality is that there is nothing women – or men, for that matter – can wear that will protect them from rape. Women who wear headscarves are raped, such as the late Noor Suzaily Mokhtar. Young girls in modest clothing are raped, such as the late Ang May Hong, Hasirawati Saridi, Nurul Huda Abdul Gani, and Nurin Jazlin Jazimin.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The only intervention with a guaranteed measure of success in preventing rape is to change the societal mindset that produces rapists in the first place. This means teaching our children that no human being is an object to be possessed, and that they have to respect another person’s right to bodily integrity. It means all of us have to lead by example and practice gender equality in our everyday lives instead of giving lip service to only the economic aspect of women’s empowerment.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Instead of focusing on the victims, institutions like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAIS&lt;/span&gt; should turn their scrutiny to the perpetrators, and work together with women’s groups to inculcate values of respect and integrity in schools as part of an anti-rape campaign. It would be an incredibly important role to play in an environment where myths about rape and sexual behaviour are passed off as facts by not only public institutions but political leaders, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PAS&lt;/span&gt; ulama wing’s information chief Datuk Dr Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali at-Takiri who claimed that sex education would lead to young people watching pornography and higher rates of teen pregnancies.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The Friday sermon was not only appalling, it was a wasted opportunity to educate the public on the realities of rape and how we can support rape victims instead of shaming them. Instead, the message it gives to rapists and potential rapists is that they can wash their hands clean of any personal responsibility over their actions, as long as they can justify in their minds that the victims are “asking for&amp;nbsp;it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News &amp; Events"></category><category term="victim-blaming"></category><category term="gender equality"></category></entry><entry><title>FREE PDC/AWL Seminar on Legal Case Management Support for Victims of Human Trafficking on 27 January 2015</title><link href="https://awlmalaysia.github.io/content/free-pdcawl-seminar-legal-case-management-support-victims-human-trafficking-27-january-2015" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-16T11:53:00+08:00</published><updated>2015-01-16T11:53:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Admin</name></author><id>tag:awlmalaysia.github.io,2015-01-16:/content/free-pdcawl-seminar-legal-case-management-support-victims-human-trafficking-27-january-2015</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Professional Development Committee and the Association of Women Lawyers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;) are jointly organising a Seminar by Daniel Lo on Tuesday, 27 January 2015 from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Auditorium, 4th Floor, Wisma Hangsam, No.1, Jalan Hang Lekir, 50000 Kuala&amp;nbsp;Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Professional Development Committee and the Association of Women Lawyers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWL&lt;/span&gt;) are jointly organising a Seminar by Daniel Lo on &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 27 January 2015 from 2:30 pm to 4:30 pm at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; Bar Auditorium, 4th Floor, Wisma Hangsam, No.1, Jalan Hang Lekir, 50000 Kuala Lumpur&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the&amp;nbsp;Seminar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human trafficking or more properly understood as modern-day slavery where the focus is upon the exploitation of a victim by a perpetrator is a world-wide phenomenon which exists in every country in the world. It has been estimated that there are over 27 million victims currently in the situation of modern-day slavery, including forced labour, sex trafficking and organ harvesting. All these various forms of human trafficking have the elements of exploitation of a victim by a perpetrator where the victim is unable to escape arising from the use of fraud, force or&amp;nbsp;coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Malaysia, modern-day slavery is faced by many migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers and foreign spouses totaling close to 5 million. The Malaysian Government on average rescues about 3 victims daily and thus far since the inception of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act in 2007 has rescued over 3,000&amp;nbsp;persons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the&amp;nbsp;Speaker:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel Lo joined as Special Officer for human rights with Senator Datuk Paul Low, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office in November 2013. Datuk Paul Low is the Minister for Governance, Integrity and Human Rights appointed by the Prime Minister in 2013. His role as special officer is to advise the Minister and other related government ministries and agencies on human rights matters. In this role he also engages with civil society, statutory bodies, business groups and diplomatic missions to strengthen institutions to the realisation of human rights in Malaysia and the region. Before joining Datuk Paul Low, He was with the Coalition to Abolish Modern-day Slavery (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAMSA&lt;/span&gt;) as Country Manager from 2009 and owing to the Coalition’s focused efforts, was appointed as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt; representative to both the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons of Malaysian and the Selangor Anti-Trafficking in Humans Task Force in 2011. He was also a partner and practicing solicitor in his law firm, Andrew Khoo &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Daniel Lo from where he brings and contributes over 15 years of his legal practice knowledge in Malaysia. During that time, his direct intervention in many migrant worker cases involving employment, immigration and criminal issues has provided him with first hand experiences of many violations which migrant workers face in&amp;nbsp;Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="story-container"&gt;
&lt;div id="content_1_div"&gt;
&lt;div class="story"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men are earning an average of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM2&lt;/span&gt;,260 a month, compared with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM2&lt;/span&gt;,071 for women or a difference of 8.4%, according to the National Statistics Department’s Salaries and Wages Survey Report&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, men earned an average of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM2&lt;/span&gt;,083 a month, against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM1&lt;/span&gt;,912 for women, a variance of&amp;nbsp;8.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Statistics Department did not provide any explanation over the increasing&amp;nbsp;gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also showed that men of Chinese and Indian descent earned more than women of their ethnic groups, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM418&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM358&lt;/span&gt; average monthly wage difference&amp;nbsp;respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for bumiputras, men earned an average of only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM80&lt;/span&gt; more than women each&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled female workers saw their male colleagues getting paid more with a 39.7% salary difference (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM588&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service and sales workers followed with a 34.9% difference (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM610&lt;/span&gt;) and those in elementary or basic occupations at 28.9% (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM327&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the construction industry saw women earning more than men, with a 13.1% difference (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM224&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Female workers in the construction industry were more focused in the group of skilled and semi-skilled workers compared to male workers who tend to work as low-skilled workers,” the report&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the construction industry, women were also seen topping men in terms of certain age groups and marital&amp;nbsp;statuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report found that women aged 25 to 29 and 30 to 34 years, were earning 6.8% (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM117&lt;/span&gt;) and 10.4% higher wages than men (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM208&lt;/span&gt;) on average&amp;nbsp;respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single women also earned more, with a 11.8% gap (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM178&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The margin between the two genders remained closer for those aged 35 to 44, but shot up considerably once they reached the age of&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban areas also saw men earning more than women, with a 8% gap (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM184&lt;/span&gt;). Rural women were, however, earn &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RM51&lt;/span&gt;.50 more than men, with a 3.6%&amp;nbsp;gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states also saw men paid more, with Johor (16%), Kuala Lumpur (15.6%) and Putrajaya (14.4%) leading the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changed in women’s favour in Kelantan and Sabah, having a 24.6% and 13.5% gap&amp;nbsp;respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey polled some 49,216 samples known as “living quarters” which included households and individuals aged between 15 and&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South-East Asia, Malaysian women appear to have better salaries than others in the&amp;nbsp;region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singaporean women, according to its Social and Family Development Ministry, are generally (median) paid S$3,480, compared with S$3,915 for men, a 11.1%&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
